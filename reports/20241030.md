## Whole Team Report

### Goals from Last Week
- Set up API backend framework
- Design API endpoints for handling CLI requests
- Implement message processing logic

### Progress/Issues
- Refactored proof of concept into proper CLI frontend and backend 
- Added simple vs complex commit message templates for use
- Set up basic CI/CD workflow integrated with GitHub Actions
- Integrated Pylint and basic Pytest test suite for response processing and API key security
- Flagging and filtering not quite as smooth as intended

### Goals for Next Week
- Clean up flagging and filtering processes to ensure a smooth user experience
- Expand on Pytest test suite framework in order to more comprehensively test application
- Clean up code to properly conform to Pylint standards
- Debugging as needed!

## Individual Member Reports

### Boaz

#### Goals from Last Week
- Write tests that will be run automatically to verify the functionality of our existing components.
- Research Azure KeyVault and other alternatives to store the OpenAI key securely. 


#### Progress/Issues
- Set up CI framework as a Github workflow to run on GitHub Actions.
- Added Pytest to easily run all tests, is also used for CI.

#### Goals for Next Week
- Fix current tests in GitHub repo 
- Clean up existing code so that pylint automated tests pass again
- Add functionality to manually edit a generated commit

### Chloe

#### Goals from Last Week
- Determine how/what our CI/CD pipeline will look like. Implement a basic automated testing framework.
- Also implement automatic linting upon committed code changes.

#### Progress/Issues
- Was able to setup GitHub Actions workflow and configure a pylint run on every commit to the remote repo! 
- Contributed two program tests to our test suite (one for API key security, another for flag validation)
- Dabbled a bit in the CI build setup in conjunction with my own testing process. 

#### Goals for Next Week
- Write more unit and functional (perhaps end to end) tests. 
- Also find a way to streamline our CI builds since they are currently taking very long to run.
- Suspect is pylint. I think that's taking too long. Might need to find a way to ignore some of the warnings.
