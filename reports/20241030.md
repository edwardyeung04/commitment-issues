## Whole Team Report

### Goals from Last Week
- Set up API backend framework
- Design API endpoints for handling CLI requests
- Implement message processing logic

### Progress/Issues
- Refactored proof of concept into proper CLI frontend and backend 
- Added simple vs complex commit message templates for use
- Set up basic CI/CD workflow integrated with GitHub Actions
- Integrated Pylint and basic Pytest test suite for response processing and API key security
- Flagging and filtering not quite as smooth as intended

### Goals for Next Week
- Clean up flagging and filtering processes to ensure a smooth user experience
- Expand on Pytest test suite framework in order to more comprehensively test application
- Clean up code to properly conform to Pylint standards
- Debugging as needed!

## Individual Member Reports

### Boaz

#### Goals from Last Week
- Write tests that will be run automatically to verify the functionality of our existing components.
- Research Azure KeyVault and other alternatives to store the OpenAI key securely. 


#### Progress/Issues
- Set up CI framework as a Github workflow to run on GitHub Actions.
- Added Pytest to easily run all tests, is also used for CI.

#### Goals for Next Week
- Fix current tests in GitHub repo 
- Clean up existing code so that pylint automated tests pass again
- Add functionality to manually edit a generated commit

### Chloe

#### Goals from Last Week
- Determine how/what our CI/CD pipeline will look like. Implement a basic automated testing framework.
- Also implement automatic linting upon committed code changes.

#### Progress/Issues
- Was able to setup GitHub Actions workflow and configure a pylint run on every commit to the remote repo! 
- Contributed two program tests to our test suite (one for API key security, another for flag validation)
- Dabbled a bit in the CI build setup in conjunction with my own testing process. 

#### Goals for Next Week
- Write more unit and functional (perhaps end to end) tests. 
- Also find a way to streamline our CI builds since they are currently taking very long to run.
- Suspect is pylint. I think that's taking too long. Might need to find a way to ignore some of the warnings.

### Edward

#### Goals from Last Week
- Update repo to represent the package structure reflected in the living document
- Update the main OpenAI Backend to the newest version of OpenAI's API 
- Look to implement few-shot classification from zero-shot for commit types
- Create linter file for code style 

#### Progress/Issues
- Working on implementing few-shot classification from zero-shot for commit types
- Implemented filter feature and flags for complex and simple messages
- Overall alot of code updates, readme.md etc.
- Wrote tests for the 

#### Goals for Next Week
- Help Chloe fix up the CI Build
- Write more unit tests to test more aspects of the code such as the response processor and message maker
- Fix up the complex messages occasionally failing due to not fitting the template 
- Complete implementing few-shot classification from zero-shot for commit types

### Ethan

#### Goals from Last Week
- Verify that "Add" and "Fix" change types are properly encapsulated in generated commit message
- Begin drafting templates for pre-written commit message template selection

#### Progress/Issues
- Reviewed refactored codebase for updated logic and structure
- Created analysis for potential CI services
- Assisted in integrating and updating CI/CD workflow for Pylint and Pytest test suite

#### Goals for Next Week
- Review codebase for conflicts with Pylint (2 days)
- Research methods for storing OpenAI Key in a secure manner (1 day)
- Expand on existing Pytest test suite to ensure response processing is properly being tested. Ensure at least one test for each change type in response processing test file (2 days)
